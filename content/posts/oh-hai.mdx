Welcome to kylegoggin.com! Feel free to show yourself around. It's a little... sparse. But, I wanted to have a place to hang my hat and occasionally post a thing or two, so here we are!

In the past few months I've been working extensively with [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) and using it to build universal React components with [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web). As far as I can tell, there aren't too many other people out there working with both of those technologies, so I'm hoping to share some of my learnings here as I'm able.

I've also always secretly (or not-so-secretly) wanted to create some kind of humor-based website, so it could also be mostly weird jokes I guess. Come back and find out which! (I read you should always end blog posts with a call to action - how was that?)
