summary: I'm back to blogging! Here's a bit about what's new since my last post and what I'm hoping to write about going forward.

It’s been a bit! I’d like to get back into somewhat regularly blogging, so I’ve been (slowly) making some progress towards that goal. Step one was refreshing my blog architecture (Gatsby was sooo 2018) and I decided to give [Astro](https://astro.build/) a spin. It’s been great! I love it’s “back to basics” aesthetic for a static site like this one, but knowing I can still throw in some React if I find the need to. I’ll probably try to write more about that at some point. I also wanted to try out Tailwind’s v4 beta (which they actually [just shipped as stable](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4)) which has also been a joy to use!

Cool, got a new site. Now: what to write about? My previous writings were pretty focused on ReasonML, as that was my day-to-day language at my job at the time. These days I’m working for [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) in their core Support app, specifically on the Ticket UI. We use Typescript at Zendesk, so I’ve not really written any Reason in quite a few years. I’ve got some mixed feelings about that… probably another good future post!

I still get to work with GraphQL quite a bit, and more recently have been helping to integrate some ML-based features into our core app, which has been a really interesting challenge! I’m excited to try to explore some of those topics as well.
I’ve also been thinking a lot lately about how the Internet, and especially recent trends in social media, have affected our culture and society. Part of my reason for re-launching this blog is that I’m more convinced than ever that I want to [own my own words](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/your-words-are-wasted) and contribute to a more open Internet that’s not walled off by greedy corporations. On a related note, you can find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/kylegoggin.com) these days as well!

So, yeah. That’s about it for now I guess. Hopefully you’ll see a bit more here in the coming weeks!
